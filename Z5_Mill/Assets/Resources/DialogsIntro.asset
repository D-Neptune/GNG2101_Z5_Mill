      into a workpiece.
    - Let's start by examining the main components of a typical mill.

  - name: Getting Started - Drilling
    frenchName: 
    sentences:
    - Let's first examine the setup. The workpiece is firmly clamped into the vise
      - it is important that the vice is not clamped too tightly, as this could deform
      the workpiece.
    - The drill bit is also fixtured inside the drill chuck, and the drill chuck
      is secured to the head of the mill.
    - There are also a few things to keep in mind when positioning the mill for drilling
      operations.
    - First locate the spot on the workpiece that you need to drill. Often times
      a centre-punch is used to mark this location.
    - Next lower the head of the mill such that it is only a couple inches above
      the workpiece
    - Now we can adjust the x and y position of the table to align the spot to drill
      directly under the drill-bit
    - With the workpiece and tool in position, we are almost ready to begin drilling.
      But first we must determine and set the rigth cutting speed
    - A simple formula can be used to estimate the rotation speed of the cutter knowing
      the material of the workpiece and the diameter of the cutting tool
    - 'RPM = 4x Cutting Speed / Diameter

'
    - 'For example, milling with a 1/2'' endmill in steel:

      Cutting Speed (steel)
      = 80 SFPM

      Cutter Diameter = 0.5 inch

      RPM = 4 x 80 / 0.5

      RPM
      = 640 RPM'
    - With the correct speed set we can now turn on the machine.
    - Proceed to lower the spindle with the quill feed until you touch the surface.
      Remove material from the workpiece in increments by raising and lowering the
      drill in a pecking motion
    - Continue until the drill bit has piereced through the matieral.
    - Well done! Next we will learn side milling.

  - name: Getting Started - Face Milling
    frenchName: 
    sentences:
    - Face milling is the process of removing material from the face of a workpiece.
    - The process here is very similar to the side milling operation.
    - We will first lower the tool until it touches the surface, set the reference
      point, move off of the surface, lower the depth of cut, then walk across the
      surface. removing material
    - Proceed by lowering the head of the machine until the endmill touches the surface.
    - Position the workpiece so it is below the tool
    - Lower the quill feed so that the tool is now only slightly above the workpiece
      and the lock the quill into position
    - Now you may turn on the machine.
    - Proceed by using the fine adjustment knob to lower the tool until it contacts
      the surface of the workpiece
    - 'Now you will set the reference point in the z direction, and then move the
      tool off the workpiece by moving the table in the x

'
    - As before, set the depth of cut to 0.01 inch (0.254 mm) and walk across the
      surface of the material
    - Similarly as with side milling, this process can be repeated many times until
      the desired dimensions are achieved

  - name: Getting Started - Side Milling
    frenchName: 
    sentences:
    - Side milling is the process of removing material from  the side of a workpiece.
    - For drilling we used a drillbit, however we must use a tool called an endmill
      for sidemilling operations.
    - End mills are similar to drill bits in that they have flutes that will allow
      them to drill into a workpiece...
    - but they also can be used to machine the side or face of a workpiece since
      they are more able to handle radial loads.
    - The workpiece is fixed in place with the target face extending beyond the vise
      so that it will not be damaged by the mill
    - Again, we will lower the head into position and lock it place.
    - Next lower the spindle so that bottom of the tool is well below the workpiece
    - With everything in place, let's start the machine.
    - Begin by moving the table slowly until the end mill touches the surface of
      the material
    - One you have touched the surface, set the reference point along the x-axis
      by hitting the zero button on the DRO
    - Back off the end mill from the workpiece slightly, then move the table in the
      y-direction until the end mill clears the workpiece
    - Next move in the x direction to a controlled depth at which we will make our
      first cut. This time we will use a depth of 0.01 inch (0.254 mm)
    - To make the cut, move the table in the y-direction such that the tool is walking
      along the face of the workpiece
    - To make the cut, move the table in the y-direction such that the tool is walking
      along the face of the workpiece
    - Note that because we only moved the y direction, we have created a uniform
      face that is perpendicular to the jaws of the vise
    - This process may be repeated until the desired amount of material is removed
      from the workpiece.
