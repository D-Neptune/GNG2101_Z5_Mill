    sentences:
    - Welcome to the Basic Mill Training Workshop.
    - The milling Machine is an advanced machinery used in subtractive Manufacturing
    - Milling is the process of machining removing material by advancing rotary cutters
      into a workpiece.
    - Let's start by examining the main components of a typical mill.
    - 'In this tutorial we will learn 3 fundamental operations that can be performed
      on the mill: Drilling, Facing, and Side Milling'

    sentences:
    - Let's first examine the setup. The workpiece is firmly clamped into the vise
      - it is important that the vice is not clamped too tightly, as this could deform
      the workpiece.
    - The drill bit is also fixtured inside the drill chuck, and the drill chuck
      is secured to the head of the mill.
    - There are also a few things to keep in mind when positioning the mill for drilling
      operations.
    - First locate the spot on the workpiece that you need to drill. Often times
      a centre-punch is used to mark this location.
    - Next lower the head of the mill such that it is only a couple inches above
      the workpiece
    - Now we can adjust the x and y position of the table to align the spot to drill
      directly under the drill-bit
    - With the workpiece and tool in position, we are almost ready to begin drilling.
      But first we must determine and set the rigth cutting speed
    - A simple formula can be used to estimate the rotation speed of the cutter knowing
      the material of the workpiece and the diameter of the cutting tool
    - 'RPM = 4x Cutting Speed / Diameter

'
    - 'For example, milling with a 1/2'' endmill in steel:

      Cutting Speed (steel)
      = 80 SFPM

      Cutter Diameter = 0.5 inch

      RPM = 4 x 80 / 0.5

      RPM
      = 640 RPM'
    - With the correct speed set we can now turn on the machine.
    - Proceed to lower the spindle with the quill feed until you touch the surface.
      Remove material from the workpiece in increments by raising and lowering the
      drill in a pecking motion
    - Continue until the drill bit has piereced through the matieral.
    - Well done! Next we will learn facing.
